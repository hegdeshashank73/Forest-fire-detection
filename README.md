# Forest Fire detection and animal locating.

This project focuses on early detection and prevention of forest fires using image processing and machine learning. Utilizing OpenCV, we simulate drone cameras by employing webcams to detect fires promptly. Additionally, the system identifies animals near the fire and notifies the forest department via automated emails. It also maps the animals' locations on Google Maps.
